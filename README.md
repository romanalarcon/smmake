smmake
------

This is a simple state machine generator written in C++. It is an initial version that has to be (of course) improved, but it was useful in some projects for iOS and Android.

smmake makes possible to create a state machine from a specification written in a simple language. The output can be C++, Objective C, Java or Swift, but it is possible to add new generators easily. The tool also generates a DOT specification to provide a graph that can be viewed using tools like GraphViz.
